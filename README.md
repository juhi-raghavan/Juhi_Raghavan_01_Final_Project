My part of the project was importing the data into MATLAB and graphing the rough data as a scatter plot. 
I was able to create a table - called dataet - by using the readtable() function and used the parameters "VariableNamingRule" and "Preserve" to keep the variable names we created in our spreadsheet
Then, in order to plot the data, I created a scatter plot using the year as the x axis and the average CPI as the y axis. I created a title and axis labels for readability

(Year and Annual Average columns used)
